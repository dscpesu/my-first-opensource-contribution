## ABOUT ME
I am an enthusiastic learner who is fascinated by technology and its transformative impact on mankind. This fascination has driven me to acquire skills and knowledge in areas such as coding, networking, drone programming (in Python), linear regression, web scraping, web development, and LoRa (Long Range) communication using UART protocol.

I believe that having skills is just the first step, and using these skills to solve real-world problems is essential. I have applied my knowledge in projects, including GPS-based location finding, server-client communication, linear regression, and utility programs.
