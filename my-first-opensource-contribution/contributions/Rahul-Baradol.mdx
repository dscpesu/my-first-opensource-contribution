# About Me
I am Web Developer and a Cloud Enthusiast. My tech stacks include React, Nextjs, Tailwind CSS, Next UI, BootStrap and so on...
Apart from dev, I also love solving problems of DSA and participate in contests of CodeChef and LeetCode. I have also secured a 2nd place in Alcoding Practice Placement Series
hosted by my university!

# Projects
I have a project named Flow Puzzle Solver (https://flowpuzzlesolver.vercel.app)
If you have played the game Flow Free on your mobile, then you get to solve some puzzles in that game.
And I have designed a algorithm which solves the puzzles of that game!! Yeah! I have used Recursion 
concepts and a bunch of other data structures to optimize the algorithm, and the solution to the
puzzle is shown to the user using React and Bootstrap in a graphical fashion! 

I am currently working on my portfolio.
