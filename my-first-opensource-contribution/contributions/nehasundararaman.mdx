# About Me

I am Neha Sundararaman, currently studying in the third semester. Ever since I was little, I have always been interested in two main categories, computer science and music. Now, I am pursuing my passion for CS and learning more as I go.

# Experience

I have been with PVL as a learner for the past year and have learned about image processing and its relation with IoT.

# Projects

- A line-following robot car created as part of a project for PVL which uses image processing to detect a black line and follow it till the end.
- Face detection in motion – for a hackathon on the topic of advanced number plating recognition and face recognition.
- An alarm clock – for a college assignment in Python.
- Hotel management database – for a school project in Python.
